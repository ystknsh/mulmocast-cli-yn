      "imagePrompt": "A detailed scientific illustration of small, early tree-dwelling primate ancestors in a lush prehistoric forest canopy. Show several small mammals with distinctive forward-facing eyes and grasping hands clutching branches. Include anatomical details highlighting their specialized limbs for climbing and depth perception adaptations. The style should be realistic, educational, and suitable for a scientific presentation, with soft natural lighting filtering through the forest canopy. The scene should clearly demonstrate the arboreal lifestyle that shaped primate evolution."
